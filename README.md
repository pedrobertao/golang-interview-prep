## Golang Interview Prep 

This GitHub repository is a comprehensive resource for individuals preparing for technical interviews focused on Go (Golang). It features a curated collection of interview questions covering essential topics for mastering Go, such as language syntax, concurrency patterns, data structures, algorithms, and real-world application development scenarios. Each question includes detailed explanations and code snippets to help users understand the correct answers and underlying concepts and best practices in Go programming. Contributions from experienced developers and interviewers keep the content up-to-date and relevant to current industry standards. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer aiming to refine your knowledge, this repository is an invaluable tool for your interview preparation journey.


## This will guarantee my success in the interview ?

We will gather as much information as possible, but interviews can be biased towards questions outside the scope of Golang itself, focusing instead on tools that use Golang. Therefore, the answer depends. We guarantee that we will include as many tricky questions as we can gather and the most important ones, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they will be asked in the interview.


## Documentation

The guide will be separated into files based on the spoken language, such as English, Portuguese, and others. The structure of the files will be as follows: \
[pt_br.md](https://github.com/pedrobertao/golang-interview-prep/blob/main/questions/pt-br.md) or [en_us.md](https://github.com/pedrobertao/golang-interview-prep/blob/main/questions/en-us.md) \
You will be able to find these text under the folder called questions.
